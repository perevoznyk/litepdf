litePDF SDK contains two versions of litePDF.dll and litePDF.lib files, one
is built in Microsoft Visual C++ (a coff format), which resides directly in
bin/ and lib/ folders, and one built in C++ Builder (an omf format), which
resides in bin/omf/ and lib/omf/ folders. The two libraries are interchangeable,
as long as the PoDoFo::PdfDocument is not used - it is, when there are not
used litePDF_GetPoDoFoDocument() or TLitePDF::GetPoDoFoDocument() functions.
If you need these, make sure you distribute correct litePDF.dll file with your
executable.
