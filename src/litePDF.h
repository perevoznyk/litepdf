/** @mainpage litePDF
litePDF is a library (DLL), which allows creating new and editing of existing PDF documents with simple API.
Page content is drawn with standard GDI functions through a device context (HDC or TCanvas, in case of Delphi or C++ Builder).<br>
<br>
Main features of litePDF:
<ul>
<li>create new PDF documents in memory only, or with direct write to a disk</li>
<li>load of existing PDF documents</li>
<li>modify or delete of existing pages</li>
<li>copy pages from other documents</li>
<li>incremental update of PDF documents</li>
<li>encryption of PDF documents</li>
<li>digitally sign PDF documents</li>
<li>draw with GDI functions both directly to a page, and to a resource/template (XObject)</li>
<li>draw of created resources into a page</li>
<li>font embedding, complete or subset</li>
<li>font substitution</li>
<li>JPEG compression for images</li>
<li>attach files into PDF documents</li>
<li>low-level PDF operations</li>
</ul>
<br>
litePDF uses an Open Source project <a href="http://podofo.sf.net">PoDoFo</a> for manipulation of PDF documents,
and offers direct PdfDocument pointer to the PoDoFo interface, thus the library users can do anything what the PoDoFo
offers.
*/

/** @page units Units
Since litePDF 1.2.0.0 the functions which used millimeters as their measure
units can use also inches, or fractions of the millimeters and inches.
The reason for the fraction is to not use architectural dependent types
in the API, where the @a double type is. The unit value is rounded down
to unsigned integers in the API. The default unit is set to millimeters
(@ref LITEPDF_UNIT_MM) for backward compatibility.<br>
<br>
Call @ref litePDF_GetUnit to determine which unit is currently used. To change
the unit to be used call @ref litePDF_SetUnit. For example, to create a page
of size 8.5 inches x 11.0 inches, set the unit to @ref LITEPDF_UNIT_10TH_INCH
and then call the @ref litePDF_AddPage with the width 85 and height 110
(10-times larger, because the current unit is 1/10th of an inch).<br>
<br>
All functions use the unit set for the current context, except of
the @ref litePDF_DrawResource, which has an explicit argument for the unit
value. That's for simplicity, to not need to change the units before
the function is called and then set it back after the call.
